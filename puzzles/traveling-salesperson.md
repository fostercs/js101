The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research. The problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

Here's a solution to the TSP using JavaScript, which leverages `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` where possible. This approach uses a brute force method, which is feasible for a small number of cities.

### Solution

1. **Generate Permutations**: Create all possible permutations of the cities to explore all possible routes.
2. **Calculate Distances**: Compute the total distance for each permutation.
3. **Find the Shortest Path**: Select the permutation with the minimum distance.

### Implementation

```javascript
const tsp = (cities, distances) => {
  // Helper function to generate permutations
  const permute = (arr) => {
    if (arr.length === 0) return [[]];
    return arr.flatMap((v, i) => 
      permute(arr.slice(0, i).concat(arr.slice(i + 1)))
        .map(p => [v, ...p])
    );
  };

  // Helper function to calculate the total distance of a route
  const calculateDistance = (route) => {
    return route.reduce((total, city, index) => {
      if (index === route.length - 1) {
        return total + distances[city][route[0]]; // Return to the start
      }
      return total + distances[city][route[index + 1]];
    }, 0);
  };

  // Generate all permutations of the cities (excluding the starting city)
  const permutations = permute(cities.slice(1)).map(p => [cities[0], ...p]);

  // Find the route with the minimum distance
  const shortestRoute = permutations.reduce((minRoute, route) => {
    const routeDistance = calculateDistance(route);
    return routeDistance < minRoute.distance ? { route, distance: routeDistance } : minRoute;
  }, { route: [], distance: Infinity });

  return shortestRoute;
};

// Example usage
const cities = [0, 1, 2, 3];
const distances = [
  [0, 10, 15, 20],
  [10, 0, 35, 25],
  [15, 35, 0, 30],
  [20, 25, 30, 0]
];

const result = tsp(cities, distances);
console.log("Shortest route:", result.route);
console.log("Distance:", result.distance);
/* Output example:
Shortest route: [ 0, 1, 3, 2 ]
Distance: 80
*/
```

### Explanation

1. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The `permute` function generates all permutations of an array. It recursively builds permutations by fixing each element at the start and permuting the rest.
   - `flatMap` is used to concatenate the results of `map` to a single array.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The `calculateDistance` function computes the total distance of a given route. It uses `reduce` to sum the distances between consecutive cities and adds the distance back to the starting city at the end.

3. **Finding the Shortest Route**:
   - All permutations are generated using `permute` for the cities, excluding the starting city (assuming the salesman always starts at city 0).
   - Each permutation (route) is evaluated using `calculateDistance`.
   - The route with the minimum distance is found using `reduce` to compare distances.

### Usage of `map`, `reduce`, `filter`:

- **`map`**: Used to transform each permutation to include the starting city.
- **`reduce`**: Used to calculate the total distance of a route and to find the minimum distance route.
- **`flatMap`**: Used within `permute` to flatten the array of permutations.

### Notes
This approach, while straightforward, is computationally expensive (O(n!)) and suitable only for a small number of cities. For larger datasets, heuristic or approximation algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, or Ant Colony Optimization are often used.
