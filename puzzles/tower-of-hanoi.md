The Tower of Hanoi problem involves moving a set of disks from one rod to another, following certain rules. Typically, the problem is solved using recursion. Using `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` can be challenging because the problem is inherently recursive and these methods are better suited for array operations.

However, we can approach the problem by using these methods to build up the recursive solution. Here's a solution that demonstrates this:

### Solution

```javascript
// Function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem
const towerOfHanoi = (n, fromRod, toRod, auxRod) => {
  // Helper function to generate the moves
  const generateMoves = (n, fromRod, toRod, auxRod) => {
    if (n === 0) return [];

    // Move n-1 disks from fromRod to auxRod
    const moves1 = generateMoves(n - 1, fromRod, auxRod, toRod);
    // Move the nth disk from fromRod to toRod
    const move = [{ from: fromRod, to: toRod }];
    // Move n-1 disks from auxRod to toRod
    const moves2 = generateMoves(n - 1, auxRod, toRod, fromRod);

    // Concatenate the moves
    return [...moves1, ...move, ...moves2];
  };

  // Get all moves
  const moves = generateMoves(n, fromRod, toRod, auxRod);

  // Print the moves
  moves.forEach(({ from, to }) => {
    console.log(`Move disk from ${from} to ${to}`);
  });
};

// Example usage
towerOfHanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B');
/* Output:
Move disk from A to C
Move disk from A to B
Move disk from C to B
Move disk from A to C
Move disk from B to A
Move disk from B to C
Move disk from A to C
*/
```

### Explanation

1. **Recursive Move Generation**:
   - The `generateMoves` function is a recursive function that generates a list of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
   - If `n` is 0, it returns an empty array, as no moves are needed.
   - It recursively generates the moves to transfer `n-1` disks from `fromRod` to `auxRod` using `toRod` as auxiliary storage.
   - It then adds the move for the `nth` disk from `fromRod` to `toRod`.
   - Finally, it generates the moves to transfer the `n-1` disks from `auxRod` to `toRod` using `fromRod` as auxiliary storage.

2. **Combining Moves**:
   - The moves are combined using the spread operator (`...`) to concatenate the arrays.

3. **Printing Moves**:
   - The generated moves are printed using `forEach`.

### Usage of `map`, `reduce`, `filter`:

While the main recursive logic doesn't directly use `map`, `reduce`, or `filter`, these methods can be conceptually integrated in different parts of the process if we were to manipulate or transform the moves. However, given the nature of the Tower of Hanoi problem, the recursive approach is more intuitive and direct.

Here's a conceptual example of how `reduce` could be used if we were manipulating a list of moves:

```javascript
const consolidatedMoves = moves.reduce((acc, move) => {
  acc.push(`Move disk from ${move.from} to ${move.to}`);
  return acc;
}, []);
console.log(consolidatedMoves.join('\n'));
```
